        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m George Zakkak, a dedicated student nearing the completion of my Bachelor’s degree in Management
          Information Systems at San Diego State University, with graduation set for December 2024. I also hold an
          Associate’s degree in Business Administration from Grossmont College. My academic journey has sparked a deep
          passion for systems analysis, technology management, and leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I’ve cultivated a diverse skill set through hands-on experience in systems analysis
          and project management. I’ve led teams in developing data-driven solutions to optimize operational
          efficiency, enhancing my ability to manage complex processes and deliver impactful results. My technical
          acumen is complemented by leadership training, where I have honed essential soft skills like strategic
          decision-making and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, my participation in leadership programs, such as Model United Nations and professional
          development webinars, has allowed me to sharpen my public speaking, conflict resolution, and problem-solving
          abilities in dynamic environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technology trends, leadership development seminars, and
          working on my personal development. My goal is to combine my technical expertise with leadership to impact
          the tech industry in a significant way.
